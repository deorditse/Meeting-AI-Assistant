# Oracle for cluster m2a-windows-whisper-runtime-missing.
#
# Does exactly what the Windows install guide's "Install dependencies" and
# "Build the installer" steps do (rendered from ~/publik/lib/guides/m2a.ts via
# render-guide.mts: `npm.cmd ci` then `npm.cmd run dist:win`), on a real
# windows-latest runner, then inspects the REAL packaged output the way m2a's
# own main process does: it loads the shipped `src/whisper-runtime.js` out of
# the packaged app directory and calls the exact function
# (`locateWhisperRuntime`) that `main.js`'s `getWhisperRuntime()` calls, with
# the same isPackaged/resourcesPath/appPath shape a running packaged app would
# have. This is not a source grep for a patch -- it runs the real build and
# then runs the real runtime-location code against the real build output.
#
# Exit 1 = bug PRESENT (packaged win32-x64 whisper runtime missing).
# Exit 0 = bug ABSENT (runtime present and locateWhisperRuntime finds it).
# Exit 2 = oracle could not run (build itself failed, or output layout
#          wasn't what we expected -- not evidence either way).
#
# Optional: set $env:M2A_BUNDLE_WHISPER = "1" before calling this script to
# run the opt-in bundling path instead (used as a sensitivity / negative
# control run, never as the default reproduction).

# bugfix-lab oracle — m2a-windows-meeting-audio-not-started
#
# Population: guide-installers who self-build m2a at the publik guide's pinned
# commit (matches reporter 245f7947's "m2a version 0.2.2, self-built via
# `npm run pack:win`"). This script packages m2a exactly the way the README's
# Windows build instructions say to, launches the SAME dist\win-unpacked\m2a.exe
# the reporter ran, clicks the same "Start / stop listening" button, and reads
# m2a's own on-screen status text plus the real return value of the browser
# API m2a calls (navigator.mediaDevices.getDisplayMedia) via CDP.
#
# Prints BUGFIX_LAB_PRESENT / BUGFIX_LAB_ABSENT and exits 1 / 0 accordingly
# (2 if the observation itself could not be completed), per LAB.md.

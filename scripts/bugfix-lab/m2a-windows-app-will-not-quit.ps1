# bugfix-lab oracle — m2a-windows-app-will-not-quit
#
# Population: guide-installers who followed publik's Windows guide for m2a and
# built it themselves (the guide's pinned commit is what this script's own
# commit sits on top of — see oracle.sh, which force-pushes whatever commit is
# checked out onto the CI branch). Report 8d3f1d5b: "installed m2a vie windows
# installation instructions... after installing app and opening via start, it
# is not closing... if i start m2a from powershell and press Control+C it
# closes." Report 9b5b37e4: "How to close the m2a top floating thing?" with a
# screenshot of the toolbar's Quit control.
#
# main.js creates m2a's window with frame:false, skipTaskbar:true,
# alwaysOnTop:true, type:'toolbar' on Windows, and this app registers no Tray
# icon anywhere (grepped: no `Tray` in main.js). That means the in-app
# #quit-btn toolbar control is the ONLY UI path that can end a running m2a
# process on Windows — there is no native title-bar close box, no taskbar
# entry to right-click, and no tray icon.
#
# This script packages m2a the way the README's Windows build instructions
# say to, launches the SAME dist\win-unpacked\m2a.exe a self-built reporter
# would run, dispatches a genuine CDP mouse click on #quit-btn (the same
# control shown in report 9b5b37e4's screenshot), and then observes the ONE
# thing every reporter actually describes: does the OS process end. Not a
# source grep — a real launched process, a real click, a real wait on the PID.
#
# Prints BUGFIX_LAB_PRESENT / BUGFIX_LAB_ABSENT and exits 1 / 0 accordingly
# (2 if the observation itself could not be completed), per LAB.md.
